# .htaccess File
This is a basic .htaccess file used to use the rewrite engine of a web server to redirect from one domain link to the new domain location.

This is used by <a href="http://mobogaming.com" />MoBogaming.com</a> to redirect all old links/files to the new domain <a href="https://hails.cc" />Hails.cc</a>
